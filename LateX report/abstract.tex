\begin{abstract}
Implementing a PID controller simulation to control a vehicleâ€™s steering to desired position. Graphs which show the variations of the vehicle's trajectory in response to different PID parameters. Simulator written in Python, within Anaconda environment. Bicycle model was employed as the basis of simulation. Initial-value problems solved within NumPy library. Sensitive PID parameters, only stable within small ranges. Sampling rate has no effect on output
