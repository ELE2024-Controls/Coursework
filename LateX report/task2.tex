\section{Closed-loop system}%
\label{closedloop}
A disturbance of $1^{\circ}$ applied to steering system to simulate wheel misalignment to inspect PID response. 
Each P-I-D parameter is going to me implemented in consecutive fashion after each function analysis. Simulation computes over 50 seconds with controller's sampling rate of 40 Hertz

\\
\textbf{Conclusion}
\\
Each system parameter is required to complete a desired stable output. Only values within specific ranges can achieve the required stability. Sampling rate has little to no effect on the output of the system, may require further investigation.
