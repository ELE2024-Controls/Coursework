Problem B5 - assuming x can be measured and V is manipulated accordingly. 
The effectiveness of the pid controller is determined by a graph showing 
how the distance from Xsp varies over time, an effective controller will
show the wooden ball converging to Xsp quickly and exhibiting no 
oscillations and will also have zero offset. the controller will then
keep the ball at Xsp and not allow it to diverge away from that set point. 
a good set of evidence would be a graph plotted showing that the system 
meets the requirements.
